# task_manager1
Kotlin
# Overview

As a growing software engineer, I am continually working to strengthen my understanding of different programming languages and development concepts. This project allowed me to explore Kotlin a modern, concise language widely used for Android development and backend applications. My goal was to build a functioning console application that demonstrates core Kotlin features and improves my problem-solving skills.

For this project, I created a simple console-based Task Manager. The software allows users to add, list, and remove tasks using a clean and interactive command-line interface. It uses Kotlin classes, mutable lists, input handling, loops, and control structures to manage basic task operations.

My purpose for writing this software was to practice Kotlin syntax, understand how Kotlin handles collections, and get comfortable building interactive console applications. This project helps lay the foundation for more advanced Kotlin development in the future.

# Development Environment

I developed this project using:
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, which provides complete Kotlin support.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) for JVM support.
- Kotlin SDK, which allows the Kotlin compiler and runtime to function properly.
The programming language used is Kotlin, and no external libraries were added. The program uses only Kotlin’s built-in features such as classes, lists, input/output operations, and conditionals.

# Future Work
Here are some improvements I plan to make as I continue learning Kotlin:
- Add task persistence so tasks save to a file and reload when the program starts.
- Add task editing to modify an existing task.
- Add task categories or priorities for better organization.
- Improve the user interface with clearer formatting and validation messages.
- Convert this console app into a Kotlin Android application in the future.
